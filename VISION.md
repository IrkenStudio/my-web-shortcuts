# How was this Project started?


While exploring the world of Internet, I used to stay at some places regularly for a long time. And those places were having some things that required moving my bike to them and grabbing them, again and again.

This repeated action was irritating, and unproductive. I was aware that some places were having shortcuts to access those things, but not all of them were having it. 
So I thought there should be a tool in everybody's toolbox, which can be used to create custom shortcuts for any place and anything. And this is how I created this little tool, **My Web Shortcuts**.

## What's Next?


This project started as a response to a minor problem faced by both myself and numerous other dwellers of the internet. But only time will tell what it becomes, a success, or a lesson to learn. I aim to make this tool accessible, easy to use, and simple for a daily user. 

This extension will become available for Chrome and Firefox. If a browser supports chrome extensions, then this extension will be available for it as well.
